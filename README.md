# ZooHackathon

# Organization:
Kalahari Conservation Society and Vulcan organisation

# Introduction
Local communities take a huge part in the saving and protecting the wildlife. In areas where people live near the wildlife, inevitable conflicts (for example, destruction of livestock or spoilage of cereals) can jeopardize public support aimed at preserving wildlife and cause poaching.
The sustainable use of natural resources, the minimum number of conflicts between humans and wildlife, as well as more opportunities for safe and effective reporting of illegal wildlife activities will help us achieve results in protecting out environment and reducing incentives for wildlife trade.

# Objective:
To create a clear mechanism for local communities that will make it possible to report about illegal wildlife actions to relevant authorities.

# Problem:
We believe that there are a lot of wildlife incidents that are not reported to the relevant authorities or which are reported too long after that incident.

# About Us
